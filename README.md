# Data Structures!

Some Java implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. This repository serves as both a reference and a learning resource for concepts I'm interested in.

### Objects
- `Interval.java` - Implementation for interval representation and operations

### Graph
- `DirectedGraph.java`
- `UndirectedGraph.java` 
- `UndirectedWeightedGraph.java`
- `WeightedDirectedGraph.java`

### Tree
- `AugmentedIntervalTree.java` - Interval tree (augmented BST)
- `RedBlackTree.java` - Red-Black balanced BST with full operations
- `RedBlackTreeMap.java` - Map implementation using Red-Black tree (achieves similar perf to Java TreeMap)
- `UnionFind.java` - Union-Find (Disjoint Set) data structure with union-by-rank and path compression
